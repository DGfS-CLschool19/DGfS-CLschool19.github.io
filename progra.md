## Course Abstracts


### Embeddings in Natural Language Processing ([Eva-Maria Vecchi](https://www.vecchi.com/eva/)) {#embd-course}

In this course, we will discuss the design and construction of
embeddings in Natural Language Processing tasks. In particular,
we will explore the trend in NLP to capture and use semantic
embeddings to accurately approximate a human’s ability to
understand words and phrases. The course will emphasize both
theory and practice, providing a strong background to motivate
the use of various techniques, as well as an apt environment to
get your hands dirty with real-world implementations.

The course will motivate the use of embeddings. We will provide a
background in how we can define meaning in language use, then
explore the mathematical structures necessary to model this
information within a computationally practical framework. The
course will focus on the use, flexibility, and limitations of
these structures in NLP tasks, and how best to ground and assess
these models.

This course aims to provide an opportunity to study the state of
the art in the field of Computational Semantics, specifically
Distributional Semantics. We will discuss and experiment with
various types of embeddings, from simple count-based
representations to neural network implementations, and explore a
range of NLP tasks tackled using these methods and discuss future
directions left unexplored.


### Reflected Text Analysis beyond Linguistics ([Nils Reiter](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/mitarbeiter/reiterns/)) {#refl-course}

Computational linguistics tools, methods and ideas are
increasingly used in other scientific areas. This class looks at
digital humanities (DH) in particular, and discusses how and with
what purpose CL methods can and should be applied within DH. 

The class covers first the creation of reference data. Reference data
to be used in quantitative scenarios needs to be annotated coherently,
which usually presumes an inter-subjective agreement on the annotation
categories. We will look at ways of establishing annotation guidelines
during the annotation process. Secondly, the created reference data is
used in machine learning scenarios. This section contains discussion
of several (basic) ML algorithms, and their use in a shared task-like
scenario. We will also talk about ways of harvesting large,
out-of-domain data sets (domain adaptation). The third section will be
the evaluation and critically reflected interpretation of the results,
and their integration into other research workflows from the
humanities.

The class will be a mixture of lectures and exercises, and does
not presuppose previous knowledge in computational
linguistics. The class is also open to students from
the (digital) humanities with an interest in reflected text
analytics.


### Ethics in Natural Language Processing ([Thomas Arnold](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/staff_ukp/detailseite_mitarbeiter_1_53376.en.jsp)) {#ethics-course}

Machine Learning and Natural Language technologies are integrated
in more and more aspects of our life. Therefore, the decisions we
make about our methods and data are closely tied up with their
impact on our world and society. In this course, we present
real-world, state-of-the-art applications of natural language
processing and their associated ethical questions and
consequences. We also discuss philosophical foundations of ethics
in research. 

Core topics of this course:

- *Philosophical foundations:* what is ethics, history, medical and
  psychological experiments, ethical decision making.
  
- *Misrepresentation and bias:* algorithms to identify biases in models
  and data and adversarial approaches to debiasing.
  
- *Privacy:* algorithms for demographic inference, personality
  profiling, and anonymization of demographic and personal traits.
  
- *Civility in communication:* techniques to monitor trolling, hate
  speech, abusive language, cyberbullying, toxic comments.
  
- *Democracy and the language of manipulation:* approaches to identify
  propaganda and manipulation in news, to identify fake news,
  political framing.
  
- *NLP for Social Good:* Low-resource NLP, applications for disaster
  response and monitoring diseases, medical applications,
  psychological counseling, interfaces for accessibility.


### Syntactic Structures Can't Be Just Anything ([Meagan Fowlie](https://meaghanfowlie.com/)) {#syntax-course}

How do people automatically figure out the structure of a sentence
just by hearing it?

What kinds of mistakes can people make in trying to figure out the
structure, and why?

This course will explore these questions from a formal perspective, by
examining the mathematical properties of human language syntax,
including the complexity of human language, and parsing algorithms for
context free and mildly context sensitive language families.
